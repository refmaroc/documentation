**Have you seen this page?**

![Internal server error occured](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Internal-server-error-occured.png) 

Don't worry, probably it is not that complicated as it may seem!

**How to see what's the error about?** 

You need to log in at your **Panel** > **Tools** > **Logs**, then you will see something like: 

![System logs eshop test](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/System-logs-eshop-test.png) 

Here are the error logs that happened in the application and a bit of explanation of what's going on. 

* If you can't access to your panel, probably your MySQL server is gone. Contact your hosting provider.
* If you can't access to your site, contact your hosting provider as well.

**If you can't access your error log** follow these steps: 

* Open in your editor **/oc/bootstrap.php** (accessed from file manager or FTP)
* Search for **=== 'reoc.lo'** and replace it with **!== 'reoc.lo'** (change Ligne 36 from **elseif (OC_DEBUG OR $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] == 'reoc.lo'** to **elseif (OC_DEBUG OR $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] != 'reoc.lo')** )
* Now you should see the error with some debug information in the footer
* Revert the changes on the bootstrap.php file

**If you still don't see any error at your logs**, you can check the error log at your hosting. 

In your **cPanel** it's located at **Home** > **Logs** > **Error Log.** If you are the admin of your server, you can type: 

<code>sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log</code> or something similar to see all the errors
